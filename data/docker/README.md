# Docker

Here lies my glorious (and occasionally disastrous) Docker projects and
configurations. From containers to clusters, this is where I push the limits of
what's possible.

## Contents

- 🛠️ Dockerfiles
- 📜 docker-compose configurations
- ⚡ Experiments with containerized applications

Dock responsibly!
