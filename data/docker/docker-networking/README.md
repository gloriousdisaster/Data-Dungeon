## Introduction

Docker networking enables communication between containers, hosts, and external
networks. With Docker, you can create isolated and secure networks to meet
various deployment requirements.

This guide will help you:

- Understand Docker networking types.
- Create custom networks.
- Link containers to specific networks.
- Debug common network issues.

---

## Prerequisites

Before you begin:

- Ensure Docker is installed on your system.
  [Install Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
- Basic familiarity with Docker concepts (e.g., containers, images).
- Administrative privileges to execute Docker commands.

## Types of Docker Networks

Docker offers several built-in network drivers to meet different use cases:

1. **Bridge Network** (default for standalone containers): Suitable for isolated
   applications running on a single host.
2. **Host Network**: Shares the host's networking stack, bypassing container
   isolation.
3. **Overlay Network**: Ideal for multi-host container communication in Swarm
   mode.
4. **None Network**: Disables networking, providing complete isolation.
