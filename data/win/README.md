# Windows

This folder is dedicated to my Windows-specific scripts and configurations. From PowerShell scripts to tweaks, this is where I wrangle the beast that is Windows.

## Contents

- 📜 PowerShell scripts
- 🛠️ Registry hacks
- 🔧 Configuration files

Windows might be chaotic, but it's my kind of chaos.
