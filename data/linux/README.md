# Linux

Linux is life, and this folder is where I channel my love for open-source
systems. From server setups to random tinkering, this is the land of penguins
and perfection.

## Contents

- 🖥️ System configurations
- 📜 Scripts and tools
- 🛠️ Kernel and package experiments

For the glory of Linux!
